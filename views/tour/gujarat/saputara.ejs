                Saputara hill station is situated in the district of Dang. It is a part of the Sahyadri range of mountains and the highest point is at an altitude of 1081 metres from sea level. After the very first rain of the season, the whole area comes out full of greenery, frequent waterfalls, and gushing streams. Saputara Adventure Camp is all about feeling the thrill of camping in these most beautiful hills. The participants will stay in tents, visit tourist places and hike up to nearby hills. The city has been developed as a Hill Station by the government and is a hot favourite place of tourists all the way coming from Gujarat, Nashik and Bombay. The place is also famous for its rich tribal heritage and festivals. Many museums are here showing the culture of the Dangs, the local tribe.
